# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
My first Java Game

# Advanced Tic Tac Toe Game 4*4 with ability to  change size of the board (3x3 4x4 5x5 etc).

# Doesn't have appropriate OOP structure; was written mostly for training problem solving skills and logic: how to implement Tic Tac Toe for board, that is resizable and without hardcoding all possible results for checking the winner.
